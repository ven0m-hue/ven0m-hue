-  Self proclaimed amateur astronomer. Anything remotely related to astronomy, avionics aka Space Science and Tech. I'm in.
-  I write funny blogs on astronomy. Sometimes. 
-  Well well, I am not all space and stuff. I sometimes get lost in philosophy, metaphysics.
-  Neuroscience, EEG, ECG, BCI interests me.
-  I am all ears for a one on one conversation. If you love to talk about the future, life, spirituality, purpose, and money. Hit me up!
